13) Command to take backup of mysql Database through command line :-

To start, SSH into the first server (using a tool like PuTTy) as a user with sufficient privileges to work with the server. 
Execute the following command at the terminal to dump the database to a file:

mysqldump -u [username] -p [database_name] > [dumpfilename.sql]

You will be prompted for the password and the export will begin. Note that you should replace each variable in brackets with the
proper values and do not include the brackets.

When the export is complete, it’s helpful to compress the file to make it transfer to the new server faster. To do so, run the 
following command:

tar zcf dumpfilename.tar.gz dumpfilename.sql

replacing dumpfilename with your actual file name.

Next, transfer the compressed file to your new server, either by making it available at a web address at the old server and 
using wget, or by using FTP to download and upload the file.

Once the file is on the new server, start be decompressing it using the following command:

tar zxf dumpfilename.tar.gz

You’ll now have your original file dumpfilename.sql that you can import into your database. To begin the import process, use 
the command:

mysql -u [username] -p [database_name] < [dumpfilename.sql]

You will be prompted for the password and the import will begin. Note that you should replace each variable in brackets with 
the proper values and do not include the brackets.

When the terminal returns to the ready cursor, the import is complete.

14) Changing the Time Zone

https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/centos-linux-6-7-changing-timezone-command-line/

Amazon Linux instances are set to the UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) time zone by default, but you may wish to change the 
time
on an instance to the local time or to another time zone in your network.

To change the time zone on an instance

    Identify the time zone to use on the instance. The /usr/share/zoneinfo directory contains a hierarchy of time zone data 
    files. Browse the directory structure at that location to find a file for your time zone.

    [ec2-user ~]$ ls /usr/share/zoneinfo
    Africa      Chile    GB         Indian       Mideast   posixrules  US
    America     CST6CDT  GB-Eire    Iran         MST       PRC         UTC
    Antarctica  Cuba     GMT        iso3166.tab  MST7MDT   PST8PDT     WET
    Arctic      EET      GMT0       Israel       Navajo    right       W-SU
    ...

    Some of the entries at this location are directories (such as America), and these directories contain time zone files for 
    specific cities. Find your city (or a city in your time zone) to use for the instance. In this example, you can use the 
    time zone file for Los Angeles, /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Los_Angeles.

    Update the /etc/sysconfig/clock file with the new time zone.

        Open the /etc/sysconfig/clock file with your favorite text editor (such as vim or nano). You need to use sudo with your 
        editor command because /etc/sysconfig/clock is owned by root.

        Locate the ZONE entry, and change it to the time zone file (omitting the /usr/share/zoneinfo section of the path). For 
        example, to change to the Los Angeles time zone, change the ZONE entry to the following.

        ZONE="America/Los_Angeles"

        Save the file and exit the text editor.

    Create a symbolic link between /etc/localtime and your time zone file so that the instance finds the time zone file when it 
    ferences local time information.

    [ec2-user ~]$ sudo ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Kolkata /etc/localtime

    Reboot the system to pick up the new time zone information in all services and applications.

    [ec2-user ~]$ sudo reboot

15) To extract package :-
    tar -xvf file.tar
    tar -xzvf file.tar.gz
    tar -xjvf file.tar.bz2

16) # find / test
    # find / phpmailer | grep mailer

17) sudo yum install epel-release ( Use this command to install phymyadmin if yum commnad doesn't work ) 

sudo sed -i "s/mirrorlist=https/mirrorlist=http/" /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo 

sudo yum install phpmyadmin

# sudo yum --enablerepo=epel install phpmyadmin

18)  Create a text file containing the following statement on a single line. Replace the password with the password that 
you want to use.

SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('MyNewPass');

19) Backup Copy Command :
cp -rfp /var/www/html/etc.... /home/ec2-user/

27) command to configure cronjob : ( Default Path /var/spool/cron )
# crontab -e ( */15 * * * * /opt/date/test.sh [ file path ] )

28) Congigure autoservice start after reboot : ( /etc/init.d [ startup services file path ] )
# chkconfig --add httpd
# chkconfig --level 3 httpd on

29) tar -czvpf fullbackup1.tar.gz /opt/test/ ( Backup command with permission )
30) tar -xzvpf fullbackup1.tar.gz ( Command to extract the backup )
