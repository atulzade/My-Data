Configure NTP Client on CentOS 7

Configure NTP Client on CentOS 7

This is pretty straight forward, basically we are going to setup our CentOS 7 machine to sync with an internal NTP server to get time.

login, and su to root

from here install the ntp package

issue the ntpdate command to sync with an external time source, you may also want to sync it with an internal one to get better results

now edit the ntp.conf so Linux knows what time servers to sync with on startup

edit/cusomize lines 19-23 as follows, and customize as necessary

set the service to run on startup

now start the service
