Administering Local Password Policies in CentOS 7

July 20, 2014 by The Urban Penguin

centos7 Password PoliciesNew into Enterprise Linux 7 which includes CentOS 7, Red Hat 7 and Scientific Linux 7 is the ability to 
create and manage password policies. These policies make of the PAM module pam_pwquality.so. In EL 7 this module replaces the 
original pam_cracklib.so. The new PAM module is enabled in the file /etc/pam.d/system-auth so that when password changes are 
implemented the password is compared against the policy that we create in the /etc/security/pwquality.conf. As a simple test we 
can use the command pwscore to evaluate a potential passwords without having to change passwords.

 
Configuring Password Policies

Entries in the pwquality file can include the following examples:

    difok =3 Where we say we need a minimum of 3 different characters in a new password when compared against the current password
    minlen = 8 Where we require a password length of a minimum of 8 characters
    ucredit = -1 Where we require a least 1 upper case letter
    lcredit = -1 Where we require at least 1 lower case letter
    dcredit = -1 Where we require at least 1 number
    ocredit = -1 Where we require at least 1 non-alphanumeric character

minclass = 2 States that we need at least 2 classes or characters: )upper, lower, digit and other
maxrepeat = 3 Where we reject passwords that have occurrences a 4 or more repeating identical characters
maxclassrepeat = 2 Where we reject passwords that have 3 or more consecutive characters of the same class
