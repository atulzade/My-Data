Resolution

    The up2date command in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 excludes kernel updates by default. The yum in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 includes kernel updates by default.

    To skip installing or updating kernel or other packages while using the yum update utility in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, use following options:

    Temporary solution via Command line:

Raw

# yum update --exclude=PACKAGENAME 

For example, to exclude all kernel related packages:
Raw

# yum update --exclude=kernel*

    To make permanent changes, edit the /etc/yum.conf file and following entries to it:

Raw

[main]
cachedir=/var/cache/yum/$basearch/$releasever
keepcache=0
debuglevel=2
logfile=/var/log/yum.log
exclude=kernel* redhat-release*                           <==== 

NOTE: If there are multiple package to be excluded then separate them using a single space or comma. Also, do not add multiple exclude= lines in the configuration file because yum only considers the last exclude entry.

To exclude 32 bit packages edit /etc/yum.conf file.
Raw

exclude=*.i?86 *.i686
