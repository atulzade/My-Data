        ClientAliveInterval
           Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which
        if no data has been
           received from the client, sshd will send a
        message through the
           encrypted channel to request a response from the
        client.  The default
           is 0, indicating that these messages will not be
        sent to the
           client.  This option applies to protocol version
        2 only.
        ClientAliveCountMax
           Sets the number of client alive messages (see
        above) which may be
           sent without sshd receiving any messages back
        from the client.
           If this threshold is reached while client alive
        messages are being
           sent, sshd will disconnect the client,
        terminating the session.
           It is important to note that the use of client
        alive messages is very
           different from TCPKeepAlive (below).  The client
        alive mes-
           sages are sent through the encrypted channel and
        therefore will not
           be spoofable.  The TCP keepalive option enabled
        by TCPKeepAlive
           is spoofable.  The client alive mechanism is
        valuable when the client
           or server depend on knowing when a connection
        has become
           inactive.


           The default value is 3.  If ClientAliveInterval
        (above) is set to 15,
           and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default,
        unresponsive
           ssh clients will be disconnected after
        approximately 45 seconds.


        Set this in your sshd_config and restart opensshd


        Hth 




        From the sshd_config that I have, there is no entry 

    like ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax in
    this file.  Should I create the entry in that file?
    Besides, if there is no such entries in that file,
    what is the default value then ?



in /etc/ssh/sshd_config insert


ClientAliveInterval 600
ClientAliveCountMax 3


That will give you an timeout of 30 minutes (600 sec x 3)
